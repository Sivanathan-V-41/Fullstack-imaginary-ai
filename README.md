# Imaginary A.I.

A dynamic portfolio platform showcasing fascinating Artificial Intelligence projects and research.

## About

Deep Learning is an evolving field of Machine Learning that aims to bring us closer to true **Artificial Intelligence**. After completing deep learning courses from MIT, Stanford, Udacity, and Coursera, I embarked on various AI projects to reinforce my knowledge and push the boundaries of innovation.

This platform is a glimpse into some of the most exciting experiments and applications of AI that I have explored.
